    <p><b>Without the expertise of professionals who turn cutting-edge technology into 
actionable insights, data is nothing. This is why, more and more organizations are 
opening up their doors to data science and unlocking its power— making much <br />
more informed decisions (with data-driven evidence), directing actions based on 
trends, refining and targeting the right audience, and more.
It is becoming clear by the day that there is enormous value in data processing and 
analysis—and that is where data science pros step into the spotlight - data analysts,<br /> 
data engineers, and data scientists!
In this ebook, we will learn all about what these data pros are supposed to do, 
how much do they earn based on their geography and experience, and sometimes 
industry too.
